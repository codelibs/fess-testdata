Self-Signed SSL Certificate Test Environment
==============================================

## Overview

This environment provides a test HTTPS server with self-signed SSL certificate for testing Fess crawling capabilities over HTTPS.

## Start HTTPS Server

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Stop Server

```bash
docker compose down
```

## URLs

- HTTP: `http://localhost:10080`
- HTTPS: `https://localhost:10443`

## Fess Configuration

### Web Crawl Configuration

1. Download [Fess](https://github.com/codelibs/fess/releases)

2. Configure [Web Configuration](https://fess.codelibs.org/13.4/admin/webconfig-guide.html) with `https://localhost:10443`

3. For self-signed certificates, you may need to configure Fess to accept untrusted certificates or add the certificate to Java's trust store

4. Start Crawl

## Notes

- This environment uses a self-signed certificate automatically generated by https-portal
- The certificate is valid for 'localhost' only
- Browsers will show security warnings for self-signed certificates
